This project involves developing a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that provides advanced scientific calculation functionalities. Using C# the DLL will include essential mathematical operations such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentials, complex number operations, and statistical calculations.
1-Languages- C3, HTML, CSS, JS
2- Functionality- Trigonometric Functions- sin(x) cos(x) tan(x)
3- Logarithmic Functions: log(x) (base 10)
4- Complex Number Operations: Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division
5- Statistical Functions: Mean Median Mode
